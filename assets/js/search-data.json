Pandas and DataFrames . In this lesson we will be exploring data analysis using Pandas. . College Board talks about ideas like Tools. &quot;the ability to process data depends on users capabilities and their tools&quot; | Combining Data. &quot;combine county data sets&quot; | Status on Data&quot;determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month&quot; | Data poses challenge. &quot;the need to clean data&quot;, &quot;incomplete data&quot; | . | . From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data? Hint, remember Garbage in, Garbage out? .

Extracting Info . Take a look at some features that the Pandas library has that extracts info from the dataset . DataFrame Extract Column . print(df[[&#39;GPA&#39;]]) print() #try two columns and remove the index from print statement print(df[[&#39;Student ID&#39;,&#39;GPA&#39;]].to_string(index=False)) .

DataFrame Sort . print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;])) print() #sort the values in reverse order print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;], ascending=False)) .

I think it&#39;s interesting how you can make it ascend and descend but only have to say the ascending = command once in order to get them to be exact opposites. . DataFrame Selection or Filter . print(df[df.GPA &gt; 3.00]) . Student ID Year in School GPA 0 123 12 3.57 1 246 10 4.00 3 469 11 3.45 4 324 Junior 4.75 5 313 20 3.33 7 167 10 3.90 8 235 9th Grade 3.15 10 469 11 3.45 . I think this feature could be very useful for something similar to binary search/ some sort of search engine, specifically for cleaning data because you could weed out certain input data more easily out of larger data sets . DataFrame Selection Max and Min . print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.max()]) print() print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.min()]) . Student ID Year in School GPA 4 324 Junior 4.75 Student ID Year in School GPA 11 456 10 2.75 . this feature is useful for finding out the high and low points of a dataset which might make it easier to find a middle point, but it could be hard to use for some other points of data if there is unclean data that messes with the results. . Create your own DataFrame . Using Pandas allows you to create your own DataFrame in Python. . Python Dictionary to Pandas DataFrame . import pandas as pd dict = { &quot;calories&quot;: [420, 380, 390, 300], &quot;duration&quot;: [50, 40, 45, 42] } print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF&quot;) df = pd.DataFrame(dict) print(df) print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF_labels--&quot;) df = pd.DataFrame(dict, index = [&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day2&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;, &quot;day4&quot;]) print(df) . -Dict_to_DF calories duration 0 420 50 1 380 40 2 390 45 3 300 42 -Dict_to_DF_labels-- calories duration day1 420 50 day2 380 40 day3 390 45 day4 300 42 . I think it&#39;s cool how you can have the top part seperating the tables and then define what you want them to be indexed by because it is definitely a better way to visualize the data and really understand what you are looking at . Examine DataFrame Rows . print(&quot;-Examine Selected Rows&quot;) #use a list for multiple labels: print(df.loc[[&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;]]) #refer to the row index: print(&quot;--Examine Single Row--&quot;) print(df.loc[&quot;day1&quot;]) . -Examine Selected Rows calories duration day1 420 50 day3 390 45 --Examine Single Row-- calories 420 duration 50 Name: day1, dtype: int64 . this could definitely be useful for cleaning data and making sure data in a large database matches with other data and doesn&#39;t need to be removed . Pandas DataFrame Information . print(df.info()) . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; Index: 3 entries, day1 to day3 Data columns (total 2 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype -- -- 0 calories 3 non-null int64 1 duration 3 non-null int64 dtypes: int64(2) memory usage: 180.0+ bytes None . it&#39;s interesting to me that it is able to return this information within a function of df, although I am not exactly sure when I would see myself utilizing this data. however, the dtype could help with cleaning data. . Example of larger data set . Pandas can read CSV and many other types of files, run the following code to see more features with a larger data set . import pandas as pd #read csv and sort &#39;Duration&#39; largest to smallest df = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/data.csv&#39;).sort_values(by=[&#39;Duration&#39;], ascending=False) print(&quot;--Duration Top 10&quot;) print(df.head(10)) print(&quot;--Duration Bottom 10&quot;) print(df.tail(10)) . --Duration Top 10 Duration Pulse Maxpulse Calories 69 300 108 143 1500.2 79 270 100 131 1729.0 109 210 137 184 1860.4 60 210 108 160 1376.0 106 180 90 120 800.3 90 180 101 127 600.1 65 180 90 130 800.4 61 160 110 137 1034.4 62 160 109 135 853.0 67 150 107 130 816.0 --Duration Bottom 10 Duration Pulse Maxpulse Calories 68 20 106 136 110.4 100 20 95 112 77.7 89 20 83 107 50.3 135 20 136 156 189.0 94 20 150 171 127.4 95 20 151 168 229.4 139 20 141 162 222.4 64 20 110 130 131.4 112 15 124 139 124.2 93 15 80 100 50.5 . This could definitely be useful for differentiating between top and bottom points of a large data set/ finding the max and min/ just generally seeing how much space there is between the biggest and smallest samples. It&#39;s also just interesting data to consider . APIs are a Source for Writing Programs with Data . 3rd Party APIs are a great source for creating Pandas Data Frames. . Data can be fetched and resulting json can be placed into a Data Frame | Observe output, this looks very similar to a Database | . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas can be used to analyze data&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd import requests def fetch(): &#39;&#39;&#39;Obtain data from an endpoint&#39;&#39;&#39; url = &quot;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/covid/&quot; fetch = requests.get(url) json = fetch.json() # filter data for requirement df = pd.DataFrame(json[&#39;countries_stat&#39;]) # filter endpoint for country stats print(df.loc[0:5, &#39;country_name&#39;:&#39;deaths&#39;]) # show row 0 through 5 and columns country_name through deaths fetch() . country_name cases deaths 0 USA 82,649,779 1,018,316 1 India 43,057,545 522,193 2 Brazil 30,345,654 662,663 3 France 28,244,977 145,020 4 Germany 24,109,433 134,624 5 UK 21,933,206 173,352 . knowing how to do this could definitely be vital in incorporating 3rd party data into my own pbl project or into other projects that I am working on if I just want a specific data set. For example, I might use this to incorporate a little box for snake facts into my snake game page . Hacks . Early Seed award .

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

The data that needs to be cleaned in this example is the Year in School items &quot;9th Grade&quot; and &quot;Junior&quot; because these do not fit in with the rest of the integer options. The gpa &quot;4&quot; is also an outlier because ever other one has two decimal places, making the &quot;3.9&quot; one also in need of cleaning. There is also a grade 20 option there, which is invalid, and a missing Student ID. 4.75 is also larger than the 4 limit so it could need to be cleaned. | Correlation vs causation: while the data shows a sort of trend between sunglasses and ice cream, in actuality these are two unrelated topics that cannot really have a correlation, meaning the data is initially misleading. | reflection on practice problems: . Compression question 3: I said that lossless gives same size file, but the answer was that lossy gives greater reduction in transmission time, which makes sense because the file is less quality and therefore requires less high level transition and saving of pixels. | Q3 and Q4. For Q3 I selected users might search for multiple cities, but I think I misinterpreted what they meant by that. Obviously they can search for as many cities as they want within the data set. For Q4 I picked an option that was not even being collected by the data set in a moment of weakness. The answer has to be the average ticket price because it can determine the popularity and how much people were willing to pay. |",

Reading and Encoding Images (2 implementations follow) . PIL (Python Image Library) . Pillow or PIL provides the ability to work with images in Python. Geeks for Geeks shows some ideas on working with images. . base64 . Image formats (JPG, PNG) are often called *Binary File formats, it is difficult to pass these over HTTP. Thus, base64 converts binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode) into a text encoded scheme (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits). Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.- How is Base64 similar or different to Binary and Hexadecimal? . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. | . Base64 is similar to binary and hexidecimal because it uses numbers (binary) and letters (hexidecimal) but what sets it apart is the way that it combines uppercase, lowercase, letters, numbers, and can even include punctuation in specific instances. It also combines what it tries to convert into sets before it converts it. | U0FC is the first three letters of my name (SAB) in base64, via simple base64 converter code | numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | How do these effects apply to images? | . I have been a consumer of buffering in many instances, most notably when I try to watch something and it takes a decent amount of time for the content to load in and begin playing. | The effects that I have experienced include grey screens with loading images, videos that keep pausing or skipping, and error messages saying that the loading has failed. | These effects apply to images because it may take time for them to load in and in the mean time, it may show an error or loading sign or just a grey/blank screen before the pixels are available. | Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images .
