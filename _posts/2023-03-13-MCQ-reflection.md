41/50

1. Anonymous web browsing- I said the activities will not be available for monitors, but the actual answer is that their shopping cart will not be saved. Administrators are seeing the device, not the browser.

2. Input data needed by updated system- I said the audio signal and the phone number, but the answer is just the audio signal. 

3. Algorithm to select two students from thirty- I picked A, but the answer is D. I meant to click D, so i must have misclicked.

4. Remove first and last two characters of a string- i only picked one correct answer when there shouldve been two

5. values after sequence of boolean expressions- picked c, but the fourth statement makes a false and the fifth makes c false

6. modify code to count number of robot moves- i chose b, but that would make the count twice as large as it should be 

7. why binary search wont work- i picked d, but binary search will work regardless of duplicate elements

8. result of call to proc2 procedure- the answer is d because the call to proc1 is first so to you is before happy 

9. which algorithms run in reasonable time- i chose answer b, but the number of steps is equal to 2n so it doesnt run in reasonable time
